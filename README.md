# Rosalind solutions

[**ROSALIND**](http://rosalind.info) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. It is completely language agnostic, just read the problems and paste your solutions achived in your preferred language.
In my case, I chose `python` and here are my solutions. 

Please :star: this repo if it helps you:heart:
